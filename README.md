# chatgpt-powered-morningbrieffing
An iOS Shortcut that leverages ChatGPT to deliver a highly personalized morning briefing read to you by Siri

## Requirements

### Minimal Requirements

- An iOS device capable of running iOS 18.4
- the ChatGPT app on the same device & ChatGPT account on free tier.
- Saved Memories feature activated.

### Recommended Requirements
- A recent iOS device. Anything from iPhone 12 *and* capable of running iOS 18.4. Ideally â€”but optional, Apple-Intelligence-capable device.
- The **ChatGPT app** and a **ChatGPT account on the $20 tier**. For greater performance, $200 tier is possible but entirely optional.
- Saved Memories feature activated.
- Customize ChatGPT feature activated and populated.

## Step-by-Step

1. Download the ShortCut.

2. Install the ShortCut.

3. Run it once and give all permissions asked.

### Optional

You can Automate the morning briefing by going to the Shortcuts app => Automations => [Pick a trigger] => Choose the Shortcut as the triggered action.

### Notes and Troubleshooting

By default, this Shortcut will run with ChatGPT-o4. However, it is designed to run with ChatGPT 4.5

But ChatGPT 4.5 is slow and can sometimes lead to a "timeout" error in the Shortcut, essentially stopping the Shortcut.

If you want to experience the full power of the Shortcut:

1. Open the Shortcut to edit **on your iOS device**.

2. In the "Ask ChatGPT" action, switch model to ChatGPT 4.5.

3. Sometimes, timeout errors happen randomly. It does not mean the Shortcut does not work, but only that OpenAI servers might experience a slowdown. You might also want to **restart your iOS device**.
